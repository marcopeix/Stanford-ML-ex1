# Stanford-ML-ex1
My take on the first exercise of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera.

The notebook is divided in 3 parts.

## Part 1
In the first part, I implement univariate linear regression from scratch. I also visualize gradient descent and the path it took to minimize the cost function.

## Part 2
Here I implement multivariate linear regression from scratch and make a prediction.

## Part 3
I implement linear regression in a more practical way using *scikit-learn*. I use dataframes and leverage the power of this tool to avoid writing an algorithm from scratch.
